Thank you for installing WSO2 Enterprise Integrator.

Please follow these steps to access the Management Console in the environment.

1. Obtain the external IP (`EXTERNAL-IP`) of the Ingress resources by listing down the Kubernetes Ingresses.

  kubectl get ing -n {{ .Release.Namespace }}

    NAME                                                   HOSTS                                   ADDRESS        PORTS     AGE
    wso2ei-pattern-1-analytics-dashboard-ingress           {{ .Release.Name }}-analytics-dashboard <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   2m
    wso2ei-pattern-1-integrator-gateway-tls-ingress        {{ .Release.Name }}-gateway             <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   2m
    wso2ei-pattern-1-integrator-ingress                    {{ .Release.Name }}-integrator          <EXTERNAL-IP>  80, 443   2m

2. Add the above host as an entry in /etc/hosts file as follows:

    <EXTERNAL-IP>	{{ .Release.Name }}-analytics-dashboard
    <EXTERNAL-IP>	{{ .Release.Name }}-gateway
    <EXTERNAL-IP>	{{ .Release.Name }}-integrator

3. Navigate to https://{{ .Release.Name }}-integrator/carbon and https://{{ .Release.Name }}-analytics-dashboard/portal in your browser of choice.
